Age Checker Python Script
This Python script allows you to check if a person is old enough based on their birth year. It calculates the age by subtracting the birth year from the current year (assumed to be 2024). If the calculated age is 18 or older, it prints a congratulatory message; otherwise, it informs the user that they are not old enough.

Usage
Run the script in your preferred Python environment.
Enter your birth year when prompted.
The script will determine if you are old enough and display an appropriate message.

Example
Enter the year you were born: 1995
Congrats, you are old enough!

Installation
Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
Clone this repository or download the age_checker.py file.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder containing the script.
Run the script using the command: python age_checker.py
